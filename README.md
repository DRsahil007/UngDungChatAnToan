# UngDungChatAnToan: Secure Messaging App with TripleDES and RSA Encryption

![Secure Messaging](https://img.shields.io/badge/Secure%20Messaging-App-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=appveyor)

## Overview

**UngDungChatAnToan** is a secure messaging application developed by Group 4. This application focuses on safeguarding text messages using advanced encryption techniques. The primary methods used are TripleDES for encryption and RSA for authentication. This project is part of a course on information security at Dainam University.

## Features

- **TripleDES Encryption**: Provides strong encryption for message confidentiality.
- **RSA Authentication**: Ensures the integrity and authenticity of messages.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy navigation.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with various operating systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Java, Python
- **Frameworks**: Spring Boot, Flask
- **Encryption Libraries**: Bouncy Castle, PyCryptodome
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Development Tools**: Git, Maven, Docker

   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the application:

1. Open the application on your device.
2. Create a new account or log in if you already have one.
3. Start sending secure messages to your contacts.

## Security Features

### TripleDES Encryption

TripleDES (3DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher that applies the DES cipher algorithm three times to each data block. This method enhances security compared to standard DES. 

### RSA Authentication

RSA is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm used for secure data transmission. It relies on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers. This ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt the message.
